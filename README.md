# learning_patterns

````
Social experiment
may be strange and awkward at first, Bootstrapping and Meta awareness...
How can we be better group learners? Use ourselves as guinea pigs to try out in the wild Haskell meetup, etc...

How to best learn *together*?
Is it different for every group?
Are there common patterns that can be applied to help?

```
LEARN:

  interest
  recite     ---> 
  grok             search, study, discuss, compare
  use        <---
  design
```

Can you grok but not recite?
  - unconcious / muscle memory / habit
  - analogy
  - forgetting curve (less time to learn next time?), not on the top of the stack

Can you use before you grok? (allowing concepts to wash over you, learning the conceptology, vernacular, etc...)
  - tutorial
  - lecture
  
What mixture of motivations are behind the interest?
  - $
  - world peace
  - ego
  - ...

I want to be facilitator (bring materials and ideas and general focus, traits:initiative and curiosity)
Not so much leader at all times (decide which direction to go in, how to learn, etc...)

I want to be the scribe/documentarian (grab parts that are important, unique...)
Not so much the focus of attention at all times (it takes time for me to process things within my diffuse context)

- Pick a model (explicitly) or it will be picked for you (implicitly).
- How to best manage each pattern

```
Classroom/Lecture/Talk model:

> can't work alone

  (------knowlege[a, b, c, d, ...]------)
             |             |
             V             V
        (interest[])  (interest[])

Salon/Phd poster model:

> can't work alone

(knowledge&interest[a, b, c])<-->(knowledge&interest[b, d, f])<-->(knowldege&interest[a, f, g])

Bootstrap model:

> can work alone

(interest[])<-->(interest[])<-->(interest[])
                    |
                    V 
(-----source of knowlege[book, internet, ...]-----)
```

Who is the 'audience'
Who is interested?
Who is knowledgable?
Who has power to make decisions?

Does learning need a leader || structure || ...
What if all at diff grok speeds
~Feeling~ dumb/slow/wrong can have negative effect on learning
imposed rules/constraints/traditions: Too narrow too Rigid? 
how to give EVERYONE a voice, at EVERY moment without taking off course (whos course IS it?)
Jeremy occupy RVA experience: leadership, ownership, groups?

Methods:

Roles to play 
  - (leader scribe documenter chooser)
  - roles get defined and redefined during retrospectives
  - no one person can hold role for more than x (term)
  - roles are chosen by random (dice?), by personal choice, by nomination, ...?

Pomodoro windows of focus and re-up commitments
retrospectives (meta awareness)
  discuss different layers (pathos, ethos, logos, ...)
  record for full recursive awareness
XP but with groups (mob programming)

goal 
purpose
incentive
achivement


Calibrations:
  Open surveys on habits and preferences:
    scale of 1-10 how much do you 'horde' learning materials (like a squirel)? in which form: bookmarks, books, papers, etc...

Traditions:
  Define and discuss learning concepts:
    Filter failure
    DeBonoHats
    forgetting curve
    unknown unknowns...
    empty your cup
    roberts rules of order
    adler (how to read, how to listen)
    paidea
  Learn something:
    - pick topic (abstract vs concrete scope: if/where in haskell VS von neumann architecture)
    - 25 min: define, search, categorize, summarize (tldr;) for future reference, commit to using together
